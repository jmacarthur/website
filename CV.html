<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low-level software engineer specializing in compilers, binary translation and embedded software.</li>
<li>Main skills: C, C++, Python, Assembler (Arm including ARMv8, x86, POWER).</li>

</ul>
<h2>Employment:</h2>
<h3>June 2019 - Jan 2024: Computer Architecture Engineer, <a href="https://www.cbnco.com/">Canadian Bank Note Company, Ltd</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Designer of computer architectures and other logic devices for a unique application. The goal was to create a functional, practical processor with a very low gate count (approximately 1000 transistor-equivalents). This also involved the physical design of switching elements and memory cells.</li>
<li>Designs were delivered and shown to work using Verilog and Wolfram SystemModeler simulations.</li>
<li>Two patents were applied for from this work: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11720084B2">https://patents.google.com/patent/US11720084B2</a> (granted) and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3153081A1">https://patents.google.com/patent/CA3153081A1</a> (pending).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Februrary 2013 - June 2019, April 2024 - September 2024: Senior Software Engineer, <a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk">Codethink Ltd</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>2018: BuildStream: BuildStream is an open-source project to provide a tool which orchestrates builds from multiple repositories, controlling version information of all sources, similar to Yocto and Bazel.</li>
<li>2017: Camera microcontroller: A 6 month project with one other engineer to produce an 8KB bare-metal Cortex-M0 firmware image to control a computer vision ASIC.</li>
<li>2016: GFortran legacy enhancements: Enhancements to allow GCC to process proprietary Fortran-77 features, to support a legacy codebase. Included RedHat integration work. All work was offered upstream to GCC, which provided both a technical challenge and negotiation to explain the necessity of modifying the compiler instead of patching the legacy codebase. Upstreamed 2019: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=32bef8ff8090a0d108fa14fc4088e55e57a5e6d5">https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=32bef8ff8090a0d108fa14fc4088e55e57a5e6d5</a></li>
<li>2013, 2015, 2017, 2024: In-car infotainment: Part of several small embedded teams responsible for improving performance of in-car entertainment &amp; information systems, and porting systems to a different processor in a short time frame. For different customers, I made a 10% saving on system memory and successfully ported a system to a new processor in a short time frame due to a supplier problem.</li>
<li>2014: X86 Android emulator: Architect and lead engineer for a desktop-based Android test environment. This was a modification of the X86 Android virtual machine to pass OpenGL through a socket to a native renderer, greatly increasing performance over the previous emulated OpenGL renderer. I led a team of 3-4 people to deliver this product in 2014 which received positive reviews.</li>
<li>Contributor to the company blog and Friday talks programme.</li>
