The machine isn't working properly, but this should show roughly what it'll look like when it does. There's some mild swearing on the soundtrack; mute it if you like (the audio isn't particularly important).</p>
<p>I'll be back at the Hackspace tomorrow, making another lifter (5th revision!) which should make it easier to pick up ball bearings and allow more space for a better centering system when the ball bearings are returned to the track.</p>
<p>I've been accepted to present at <a href="http://www.makerfaireuk.com/">Maker Faire UK</a> in Newcastle in March - I'll have the machine running on a stand there with some more cellular automata stuff. See you there, hopefully.</p>
