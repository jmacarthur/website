<p>A 1-of-n decoder is an electronic device which takes a number (n) of binary inputs and produces a binary '1' on one of 2^n outputs. It's a special case of a demultiplexer in which the data input is always '1'.</p>

<p>A decoder can be part of a programmable logic array. By taking the logical &quot;or&quot; function of selected outputs of a decoder, any function of the decoder's inputs can be mapped to any output:</p>

We create a series of rods for each selection input, with bumps that enable a plate to fall into a gap, with each rod moved a small distance, or not, depending on the input.</p>

The output plate can only fall if all the rods have a space where the rod can fall. In the bottom diagram, output 5 is selected by moving the 1 and 4 rods one space to the right.</p>
<p>Following is a picture of a 3-to-8 decoder I've made using laser-cut acrylic. There is nothing to drive the inputs or use the outputs at the moment, but hopefully it demonstrates the principle.</p>
<p><div class="imagebox"><div class="imagecontainer"><img class="inlineimg" src="inline_images/ram-decoder.png" alt="Physical enumerator rods"></div><center>Physical enumerator rods</center></div></p><p>In this picture, the second (2^1) rod is moved right by 5mm, and the rod in position 2 has dropped (0 is on the right). The red lever on the left lifts up all the output rods at once so the input can be changed.</p>
<p>As well as providing a means of general combinational logic, the decoder is also a vital part of my RAM system. Using a three-input decoder to select one column, and another three input decoder to select one row, we can select one element out of an 8x8 matrix, which works as a 64-bit memory.</p>
