<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="385" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIYIV7VHXKk" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>Here's a short video clip of the Mk2 Turing machine working at Derby Maker Faire. It took about 6 weeks from sending the plans off to RazorLab to having a working machine at the Handmade Digital exhibition in Manchester. There are still lots of handmade parts in the Turing machine, but having the majority of it laser-cut has made it much easier to construct.
There are also a lot of bugs in the design. One of the great things about the laser-cut design is that I can record these bugs as though they were software defects, which they are in many ways. The design for the machine is on github, at
<a href="https://github.com/jmacarthur/millihertz/tree/master/scad/newbuild/">https://github.com/jmacarthur/millihertz/tree/master/scad/newbuild/</a>, although it may not be very intelligible at the moment. I really need to spend more time documenting the design.</p>
<p>Lots of people have said they like the shiny black laser-cut Turing machine, and others have said they prefer the scrappy style of the original. Personally I'd prefer to hand-make the final version out of solid brass, but that will be several iterations away.</p>
