-access memory. Turing machines naturally have sequential-access memory; you cannot access anything that's not at the current memory location without constructing a means to access it on the tape.</p>
<p>I've also previously resisted designing anything that requires custom-made memory cells - hence the use of square metal grid and ball bearings for previous machines.
However, to make something actually useful as a computer, I've decided to relax this, while still trying to keep the number of /complex/ parts to log2 of the number of cells required.</p>
<p>Given a 1-to-n decoder is available (see [[Mechanical decoder logic]]), it then becomes necessary to make a row and column based system in which only the intersection of that row and column can be ejected, or inserted, into a grid.</p>
